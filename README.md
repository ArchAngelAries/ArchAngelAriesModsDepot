# ArchAngelAries Mods Depot

Welcome to the ArchAngelAries Mods Depot! This repository hosts a collection of mods created by ArchAngelAries.

**Important Note Regarding Nexus Mods:**

These mods were previously available on Nexus Mods. However, due to ongoing issues with the platform's moderation, including instances where I was the target of transphobic and bigoted attacks with inadequate support from the moderators, and the unfair removal of my mod "Whispered Warning Remastered" under false pretenses of asset theft, I have decided to withdraw my mods from Nexus Mods and share them here instead.

The removal of "Whispered Warning Remastered," an ESP-only mod that was a recreation and enhancement of an existing mod for Oblivion Remastered (details about the original mod and my port are below), was the final catalyst for this decision. I believe the moderation on Nexus Mods has been one-sided and unfair. You can find more details about these events in this Reddit post: [https://www.reddit.com/user/ArchAngelAries/comments/1kem7ou](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArchAngelAries/comments/1kem7ou)

This repository is now the primary location for my mods, provided for those who may be looking for them.
